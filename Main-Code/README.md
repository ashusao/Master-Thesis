### Disclaimer

The official Faster R-CNN code (written in MATLAB) is available [here](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn).

- This repository is a modified version of Faster R-CNN for detecting Object and its state (Geometric Deformable) simultaneously.
- The dataset used is a subset of MS-COCO detection dataset where every every object is annotated indvidually for its state information. Sample dataset is described in `./Main-Code/data/stateDetection/`.
- Diffrent architectures which we tried to achieve the task is described in `./Main-Code/models/`
